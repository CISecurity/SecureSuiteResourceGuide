## Introduction ##
The purpose of this document is to describe the different configurations of CIS-CAT Pro Assessor which enable the upload of assessment results to the CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard database. There are two methods in which CIS-CAT results reports can be automatically uploaded to the CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard application: POST'ing the results reports from a single CIS-CAT assessment (using either the graphical user interface or command-line user interface), and a modified version of the "cis-cat-centralized" scripts, as deployed by the "Assessing Multiple Windows Targets" and "Assessing Multiple Unix/Linux Targets" sections of the CIS-CAT User's Guide.

The following sections detail each deployment method.
