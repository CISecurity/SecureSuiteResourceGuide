# What are CIS Benchmarks?

CIS Benchmarks are best practice guidance for the secure configuration of a target system. Available for more than 140 technologies, CIS Benchmarks are developed through a unique, consensus-based process by communities comprised of cybersecurity professionals and subject matter experts around the world.

####	   How do CIS Benchmarks feed the other available CIS Products? ####

CIS Benchmarks are the foundation for each and every CIS SecureSuite product offering. CIS Benchmarks provide the content that CIS-CAT Pro Assessor uses to executes against a given target system. The recommendations within CIS Benchmarks create the contents within CIS Build Kits to automate the hardening of a system. CIS Benchmarks also feeds the development of CIS Hardened Images.

#### What are the Level 1 and Level 2 Profiles within a CIS Benchmark? ####

Most CIS Benchmarks include multiple configuration profiles. A profile definition describes the configurations assigned to benchmark recommendations.

The Level 1 profile is considered a base recommendation that can be implemented fairly promptly and is designed to have a low risk impact on system performance and functionality. The intent of the Level 1 profile benchmark is to lower the attack surface of your organization while keeping machines usable and not hindering business functionality.

The Level 2 profile is considered to be "defense in depth" and is intended for environments where security is paramount. The recommendations associated with the Level 2 profile can have an adverse effect on your organization if not implemented appropriately or without due care.

Regardless of which level profile you plan to implement in your environment, we recommend applying CIS Benchmark guidance in a test environment first to determine potential impact.

#### Are recommendations within a CIS Benchmark in order of severity or importance? ####

Each organization reviews and implements the recommendations within a benchmark in a different way. A setting might rate at the highest criticality for one organization while another organization may rate at a lower priority. Of course, the more recommendations that can be implemented without negatively impacting your environment the better. We recognize that 100% compliance may not be practical for many organizations, but closing as many security gaps as possible is the real success story. As a reference point, most organizations fall within the 70-100% passing rate and that percentage varies based on the requirements and unique tailoring to their environment.

Each recommendation includes a description and rationale section, which provides the security benefit and overall impact of implementation.  It is the responsibly of an organization to use this information and determine what is practical to implement.

#### What if I find a dispute in the Benchmark or disagree with a setting? ####
Recommendations are just that, recommendations! If an organization does not align with the CIS community's recommendation, there are a few options.

Create and document an exception for those particular recommendations
Tailor the benchmark content
Tailor the content to exclude the recommendation
Tailor the content to align with the organizational policy
Additionally, please join the community in discussing your disagreement with the recommendation. This feedback makes the community and CIS consensus based content stronger.
