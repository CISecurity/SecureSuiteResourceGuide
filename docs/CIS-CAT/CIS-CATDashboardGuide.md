#### CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard ####

The CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard provides some additional graphs and reports that can assist organizations in making CIS compliance decisions.  The dashboard shows graphs of the organizations  compliance with CIS Benchmarks over time.  The graphs can be used to drill down to individual Assessment Reports that are causing lower compliance scores so that the recommendations there in can be remediated or excepted or tailored depending on the organizations own personal security policy.

These graphs can also be used to monitor the organizations performance over time.  Once you've complete the initial work of remediating, excepting, and tailoring the content, you can then monitor the continued compliance with your custom security policy.

The dashboard also has functionality to facilitate the recording of exceptions at an organizational level, or at a target system level.  Instead of recording your exceptions in a document, you can record them in the Dashboard tool, then export reports of your exceptions for auditors to view.
